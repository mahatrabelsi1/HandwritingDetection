Handwriting Recognition with Neural Networks

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can predict the digits from both test data and custom uploaded images.

Overview
This project uses the popular MNIST dataset to train a CNN model that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9). The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and it can be used to predict digits from both test data and user-uploaded images.

Technologies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
Matplotlib
NumPy
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Setup
To set up the project and run it locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwriting-recognition.git
cd handwriting-recognition
2. Install Dependencies
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy pillow
3. Load and Train the Model
The project comes with a pre-configured notebook that includes the code to load, preprocess, and train the model on the MNIST dataset.

Usage
Training the Model
Open the HandwritingDetection.ipynb notebook.
Run the cells to:
Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
Define the CNN architecture.
Train the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model on the test data.
Making Predictions on Test Data
Once the model is trained, you can make predictions on the test images:

python
Copy code
# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = model.predict(test_images)

# Display the predicted class for the first test image
predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions[0])
print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
Uploading and Predicting Custom Images
You can upload an image of a handwritten digit (28x28 pixels, grayscale) and predict the digit using the trained model. Use the following code to preprocess and predict the custom image:

python
Copy code
# Define the path to your custom image
img_path = 'path_to_your_uploaded_image.png'

# Predict the class for the uploaded image
predicted_class = predict_uploaded_image(img_path)
print(f"Model prediction: {predicted_class}")
Example of Image Prediction
An example function predict_uploaded_image() is provided to preprocess the uploaded image and make predictions. The function converts the image to grayscale, resizes it to 28x28 pixels, normalizes it, and reshapes it to match the input format required by the model.
